# Distance Power Rankings

The Distance Power Rankings (PRs) are a set of rankings released at the end of each month that measure the overall standings of top Distance players on the official levels. The idea is that they’re a fun measure that encourages players to keep competing and improving; don’t take them as a super serious measure of players’ skill. Not everyone can or wants to grind 100+ official levels.

## Rules

There's three PR lists released at the end of each month; one each for sprint, challenge, and stunt modes. There are currently 120 official sprint tracks, 16 official challenge tracks, and 10 official stunt tracks, each of which counts for its respective PR. If you rank 10th or better on a track, you receive points according to this list:

```
 1st: 25 points
 2nd: 18 points
 3rd: 15 points
 4th: 12 points
 5th: 10 points
 6th:  8 points
 7th:  6 points
 8th:  4 points
 9th:  2 points
10th:  1 point
```

All players who tie receive full points, e.g., if two players tie for 1st, each gets the full 25 points.

Certain criteria (listed below) will disqualify a leaderboard entry for a level. For the purpose of calculating points, that entry will be treated as if it didn't exist, and entries below that player will be bumped up. For example, if on a map there is one entry ranked 1st, one entry ranked 2nd, and one entry ranked 3rd, and the entry ranked 1st is disqualifed, then the entry ranked 2nd will move up to be ranked 1st, and the entry ranked 3rd will be ranked 2nd.

### Disqualification criteria

The following can disqualify a leaderboard entry:

- Cheating. Skipping is not cheating. Rather, cheating refers to things like modifying the game to, for example, make the car go faster, or teleport to the endzone. It can also include game-breaking glitches, for example, a glitch that would make objects from one level appear in an unrelated level. Using macros to automate a series of actions is also considered cheating.
- The replay was invalidated. This refers to situations where the devs update a level but don’t wipe the level’s leaderboard, and the player’s replay is no longer possible to replicate on the updated level. An exception to this rule might be made if the updated route is faster.
- Illegal Wheelie-boosting (WB). (Doesn’t apply to stunt). This includes zero-g WB, like what's commonly used at the end of Inferno. To keep things simple and fair, even a single WB deemed illegal will disqualify a leaderboard time. See [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivWexGk_jg&feature=youtu.be&t=318) if you’re unfamiliar with the concept of WB, though note our definition of WB is a bit different from that video. Here, WB is defined as jumping, then immediately tilting the car back a bit and gripping back down. Unfortunately, it's impossible to comprehensively define what's considered an illegal WB, but I can provide some general guidelines (these are not hard rules):
  - Whenever a route requires a jump at a particular spot, you may WB there. So one WB on a wall is legal if you needed to jump anyways to land the wallride for cooldown. However, you are expected to eliminate those jumps from your route when possible, if doing so does not lose time, ignoring the speedup from the WB.
  - A WB over a drop in the road is legal, even if you could have just driven off the road without jumping.
  - WB over laser obstacles is fine, even if getting sliced by the laser wouldn't have slowed you down.
  - If, based on the car’s trajectory, it’s deemed that there’s no way the WB could have caused a net speedup, it’ll count as legal. For example, doing a WB when the car is traveling straight up a wall is (under normal circumstances) slower than just driving, so it’s legal.
- The entry has no replay. Without a replay the above rules can’t be enforced.

If one of your entries was disqualified, you can try to set a new, legal, personal best to overwrite the disqualifed entry. Alternatively, you can use [this tool](https://github.com/Seeker14491/distance-record-rm/blob/master/README.md) I wrote to remove those entries.

**Note:** Some entries in these lists have a placement on the leaderboard too low to make a difference in the Power Rankings, for example if better times have pushed it down since I reviewed it. I have not removed such times from these lists.

I will review new leaderboard entries before releasing each Power Rankings, and possibly at other times.
